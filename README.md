# Farkle Score Keeper

A simple score keeper to make it more convenient to keep score for Farkle games, instead of using paper and pencil.


## Getting Started

Upon start, you will be taken to the score screen. Enter any players you wish to include in the game, and select the point value you want to play until. 

Once you have everything set up, hit the "Start Game" button. You will be taken to the game screen.

## Keeping Score

For each roll, enter the point values of each roll. If you make a mistake, hit the "clear roll" button. After each roll, hit "Roll Again" if you wish to keep rolling, "End Turn" to record your score and move on to the next player, or "Farkle" if you fail.

At any time, you can click the "Show Scores" Button to see the current rankings.

## Winning the game

If any player hits the pre-determined winning score, you will be taken to a win screen, where the winner will be displayed at the top as well as the scores and rankings of all players.

To Start a new game, hit "play again". You will be taken to the start screen, where you can add or remove players and start again!
